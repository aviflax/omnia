FIXME: description


## TODO

### User-visible

* Add pagination to search results
* Improve searching: stemming, etc
* Ensure that only Business/Domain/Team service accounts can be added (maybe?)
* If there are no accounts/services connected, the home page should say so
* If a user disconnects their last account they should be logged out
* Google Drive: Find a way to detect when a file has been un-shared and un-index it

### Non-user-visible

* Domain model: rename “file” to “document”
* Try having the indexer return Document record instances
* Change `db` to accept/return record instances
