FIXME: description


## TODO

### User-visible

* Index Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, etc.
* Modify Google Drive Import/Sync to only import docs that are shared with the entire org
* Add pagination to search results
* Add support for "sessions" i.e. logging in and logging out
* Improve searching: stemming, etc
* Ensure that only Business/Domain/Team service accounts can be added (maybe?)
* If there are no accounts/services connected, the home page should say so

### Non-user-visible

* Domain model: rename “file” to “document”
* Try having the indexer return Document record instances
* Change `db` to accept/return record instances
